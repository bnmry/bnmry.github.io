# Hi, I'm Ben #

I'm a digital strategist who enjoys building digital campaigns that bring people together for good causes. I work for Blue State Digital in New York, where I've partnered with clients like Google, NAACP, Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, the Kapor Center, the United Way, Procter & Gamble and others.

I have a background in political advocacy, and have worked with the Podesta Group, U.S. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, the U.S. Department of Justice and Xerox Corporation.

I have a Master of Science degree from the London School of Economics & Political Science, and a Bachelor of Arts degree from American University in Washington, D.C. I am mediocre triathlete, and a fan of travel, nature and equal rights.
