I am a digital strategist in New York building campaigns online for social good. I work as Vice President at [Blue State Digital](http://www.bluestatedigital.com "Blue State Digital"), an agency and technology company that works with non-profits, advocacy organizations, and brands. I’ve led partnerships with Google, MIT, the Obama Foundation, NAACP, P&G, and many others. 

I’ve also worked at the Podesta Group, U.S. Senate, U.S. Department of Justice, Xerox Corporation, and a successful congressional campaign. 

I am a graduate of the London School of Economics and American University.

I am an occasional triathlete and photographer. I love travel, nature, and equal rights.
