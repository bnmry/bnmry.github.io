# About this site #

This website has been around in various forms since 2002. It is more of a sandbox for testing and experimentation than a soapbox to stand on. Opinions are mine, and usually half-formed. They do not represent the opinions of my employer(s) or clients.

In its current iteration, the site is served from Github Pages using static HTML generated by Jekyll, based on a theme by Cactus, which was ported by Nick Balestra.
