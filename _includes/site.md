## About this site ##

This website has been around in various forms since 2002. It is more of a sandbox for testing and experimentation than a soapbox to stand on.

In its current iteration, it is served from Github Pages using static HTML generated by Jekyll, based on a theme by Casper, which was ported to this form by Nick Balestra.
