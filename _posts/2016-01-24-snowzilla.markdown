On January 23, 2016, New York was hit with the second largest snow storm in its history. It began on Friday afternoon, winds whipping through the night and surprised us all in the morning with nearly 12 inches. The snowfall rates increased from there, letting up only late that night.

Not content with sitting around, we ventured from our home in Brooklyn through Cadman Plaza, past Borough Hall, and across the Brooklyn Bridge. We returned home through Brooklyn Bridge Park.

There were very few people out, creating a sense of solidarity in adventure that is rare in New York.
