London was hit with a snowstorm this weekend that crippled the city.  Central London saw only 3 or 4 inches, with greater accumulations in the north and west.  All the airports were shut, the Tube was halted and cars were somewhat absent.  [Saturday morning's snow globe made for some fun photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/benmurray/sets/72157625528944431/with/5284089940/).

Living in Trafalgar Square means I don't have far to slide to get it done, either.  The snow is so thick and wet that it was hard to keep the camera dry and the lens clear, but that's what sealed seams are for, amiright?  The photo above is kind of fun because there are several scenes in one.  Click on it to see it larger.

Fortunately, I made it out on the first flight back to the United States when most of the following days' flights were still cancelled.  Happy to be home.
